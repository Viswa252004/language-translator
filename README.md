# File Share - P2P File Transfer Application

A simple, real-time file sharing application that allows users to send and receive files securely over the internet using room codes.

## Features

- **Real-time File Transfer**: Send and receive files instantly using WebSocket technology
- **Room-based Sharing**: Generate unique room codes to share files securely
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor upload and download progress in real-time
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Intuitive drag-and-drop file selection
- **No Registration Required**: Start sharing files without creating an account
- **Cross-platform**: Works on any modern web browser

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file-share.git
cd file-share
```

### Step 2: Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### Step 3: Run the Application

#### Option 1: Using Only Backend Server (Recommended)

The backend server can serve both the API and the frontend files:

```bash
cd backend
node server.js
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

#### Option 2: Using Separate Servers

If you prefer to run the frontend and backend on separate servers:

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
node server.js
```

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend server:
```bash
cd frontend
npx http-server
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

## How to Use

### Sending a File

1. Open the application in your web browser
2. Click the "Send File" button
3. Drag and drop a file or click "Browse Files" to select a file
4. Click "Send File" to upload the file
5. A unique room code will be generated - share this code with the recipient
6. Wait for the recipient to join using the room code
7. The file transfer will begin automatically

### Receiving a File

1. Open the application in your web browser
2. Click the "Receive File" button
3. Enter the room code provided by the sender
4. Click "Join Room"
5. Wait for the sender to start the transfer
6. The file will be downloaded automatically once the transfer is complete

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment
- **Express.js**: Web application framework
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time bidirectional event-based communication
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data
- **CORS**: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

### Frontend
- **HTML5**: Structure of the web application
- **CSS3**: Styling and animations
- **JavaScript**: Client-side functionality
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library
- **Socket.IO Client**: Real-time communication with the server

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/upload`: Upload a file to the server
- `GET /api/download/:fileId`: Download a file from the server

## Socket.IO Events

- `join-room`: Join a room with a specific ID
- `start-transfer`: Initiate file transfer to a recipient
- `transfer-started`: Notifies receiver that transfer is starting
- `file-chunk`: Sends a chunk of the file
- `transfer-complete`: Notifies both parties that transfer is complete
- `transfer-error`: Notifies of any transfer errors
- `transfer-progress`: Updates transfer progress
- `user-joined`: Notifies when a user joins a room

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Socket.IO Connection Errors**
   - Ensure the backend server is running on port 3000
   - Check if there are any firewall restrictions blocking WebSocket connections
   - Verify the Socket.IO connection URL in the frontend code

2. **File Upload Errors**
   - Check if the `uploads` directory exists in the backend folder
   - Ensure the directory has write permissions
   - Verify that the file size doesn't exceed server limits

3. **Frontend Not Loading**
   - Make sure the frontend server is running (if using separate servers)
   - Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify the file paths in the backend static file serving
